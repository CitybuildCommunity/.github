# Security Policy

The Citybuild Community Team is deeply committed to ensuring the security of our software products and services.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any [Citybuild Community-owned repository](https://github.com/orgs/CitybuildCommunity), please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting security issues

⚠️ **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.** ⚠️

Instead, please kindly email us at security [at] city.build

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

You will receive a response from us within 72 hours. If the issue is confirmed, depending on the complexity, we will release a patch as soon as possible.

## Embargo Policy

Citybuild Community's Team members must share information only within the Citybuild Community Team on a need-to-know basis to fix the related issue. The information members and others receive through participation in this group must not be made public, shared, or even hinted otherwise, except with prior explicit approval (which shall be handled on a case-by-case basis). This holds true until the agreed-upon public disclosure date/time is satisfied.

In the unfortunate event that you share the information beyond what is allowed by this policy, you must urgently inform the Citybuild Community Team of exactly what information leaked and to whom, as well as the steps that will be taken to prevent future leaks.

**Repeated offenses may lead to the removal from the Citybuild Community project.**

## Preferred languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.
